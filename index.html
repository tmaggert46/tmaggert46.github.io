    <h1>Fire Emblem: Engage Character Building Narrative</h1>
    <div class="content">
        <p> This web page is designed to help you build a team of characters for competing in Fire Emblem: Engage. </p>
        <p> To help process the information, we are going to follow three characters and see a potential build for each one. You will be able to try different characters and different classes as much as you like, but the content will focus on those three. </p>
        <p> The builds of focus are:
             Strength build, with Etie as a beserker. 
             Magic build, with Veyle as a sage. 
             Speed build, with Chlo√© as a griffin knight. </p>
        <p></p>
        <p> As we progress, visualize the development of a character build as a story progression. </p>
